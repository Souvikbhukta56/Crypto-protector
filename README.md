# Crypto-protector
First of all the project is aimed to implement the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm (AES) using python from scratch. It uses 128 bit encryption key and 10 rounds to implement the model. The algorithm is written in Cython then it is converted in python module (.pyd extention) for performance efficiency. This AES model takes a file as an input and returns a python 3 dimentional list which contains the ciphertext in the form of integers array.
Now Crypto-protector is the application which uses the model as to transfer encrypted files from one user to another. Users can store files on cloud securely also by sending file to self. It uses the jsonbin.io currently as a cloud storage to store the encrypted cypher text. Currently it has a limitation to store a file less than 50kb as it is for prototype purpose. It also uses MySQL for storing the users and files details. Refer Architechture.png for the detailed architechture and ERD.png for Entity relationship diagram of the application. You can also refer the associated pdf file to view the application screenshots.
